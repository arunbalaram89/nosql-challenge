# Description

This assignment looked at MongoDB. With the assistance of MongoDB Compass, I was able to visualize all the records, in a very organized dictionary. You can see the full description of each record (establishment). This way, it was easy to 
interpret the data and clean it, to come up with the solutions. The file itself is a JSON file, and with Compass 

We first connected to the local host (27017), and then we were able to create our database, and classification. The activity focused on the establishments, and their characteristics, focusing on Local Authority Name and the Hygiene of these establishments.

In the end, a pipeline was created that would turn into a Pandas DataFrame.
